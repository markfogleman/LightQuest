#This file tracks decisions that were made or need to be made:

- Should I host on github or stay local?
Pro of github:
- easy interface
- visibility by potential employers
- sharing with Bagley, Pat or others
Cons of github:
- giving it away
- mistakes are visible by potential employers

Decision made to start in local repository and limit visiblity.  I don't want
fear of embarrasment to keep me from writing whatever I want and I can
always put it in a public (or private networked for cooperative programming)
later

What language to choose:
C++
- Know it the best
- Fast progress to start
- Fast
- May be difficult to write more complicated pieces in

Python
- Good project to learn the language
- May be frustrated by slow pace initially
- OO syntax seems painful
- Not sure how to lay out larger python projects

Lua
- Don't know much about it
- Easy: good long term progress
- Unsure of OO design 

Java
- Fairly easy
- Dying language?

D/Rust/Go/something else
- good project to learn something new
- may be learning something that won't last
- may not have ongoing support, dead end project

Goals of writing the game:
- To learn/improve language skills
- To keep coding sharp by working on fun project
- To show a potential employer
- To work with other people (just for inspiration)

Revisiting language decision based on the following research and issues found:
- python class hierarchies are difficult to manage
- concurrency is a pain
- python is not a common game language

Revising this decision, considering that the primary goal is to still learn
but perhaps learning new coding techniques rather than a new language.  The 
other language listed do not seem to be popular.  The most popular gaming and
overall languages still appear to be:
C/C++
Java
Objective-C

and everything else is far behind.  Java is out.  It's future is uncertain.
Objective-C is interesting especially considering iPhone apps but with swift on
the horizon, it may be obsoleted soon.  Swift is still in xcode6 beta and only 
runs on mac iOS and OSX.  The beta itself is over 2GB and download estimates 
start at 2hours.  So ... at the possible expense of not learning a new language,
I'm going back to C++

Decision made to start in python as primary goal is to learn new 
language skills.  If progress is slow, will re-evaluate over time.
